# Math/Stats/R Tutor

![me](https://j.gifs.com/K1qp3l.gif)

Hi there!
My name is Justin Patterson and I am a tutor based in Lehi, Utah. I tutor the following subjects:
- AP Statistics
- College-level Statistics
- Mathematical Statistics (calculus-based)
- Introductory Probability (up to probability distributions but nothing too fancy)
- AP Calculus
- College Algebra (If you know what groups, rings, and fields are, then I don't do that kind of stuff.)
- College-level Introductory Linear Algebra 
- R
- And more!

If you don't see the subject that you are looking for, just [message](https://www.wyzant.com/Tutors/jwp) me and I will let you know if I will be able to help you or not. I prefer to tutor online because this helps me save gas and use my time more effectively. So if you would like to book an online lesson today, then please go to <https://www.wyzant.com/Tutors/jwp>.
